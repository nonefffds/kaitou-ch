# Kaitou-Ch

A serverless try for a voting web app, a fan-made site derived from Persona 5.

Powered by AWS S3, Lambda(./Server), Amplify(prod. env), Vercel (test&dev env), Vue.JS w/ p5-ui.

## to-do:

1. use env. var for both amplify(prod. env) and vercel(dev. env)
2. Use Google reCaptcha v3 for security(the key hidden exposed in commit history is now deleted)
3. ~~change the question by client's date automatically, also add current date (question reference: https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Aficionado_Website#Persona_5_Royal)~~, add rolling comment section(texts from the game)
4. better UI I guess
5. jpn & en support (Vue I18n)
6. divide CSS and JS to other documents
7. enrich this Readme (incl. Deployments etc.)
